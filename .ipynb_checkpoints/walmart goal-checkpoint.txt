This dataset seems to represent **weekly sales data** for a retail store, including economic factors like **CPI** and **Unemployment**. Here are some advanced project ideas you can explore with this data:

### 1. **Sales Trend Analysis**  
- Analyze how **Weekly_Sales** change over time.  
- Identify **seasonal trends** or **sales patterns** during holidays (`Holiday_Flag`).  

### 2. **Impact of Economic Factors on Sales**  
- Investigate how **CPI**, **Fuel_Price**, and **Unemployment** influence sales.  
- Use correlation or regression analysis to quantify relationships.  

### 3. **Holiday Sales Performance**  
- Compare sales during holidays (`Holiday_Flag = 1`) vs. non-holidays.  
- Identify which holidays have the highest/lowest sales impact.  

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**  
- Build a model (using Python) to **predict future sales** based on economic factors and seasonal trends.  
- Apply **linear regression**, **time series analysis (ARIMA)**, or **machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest)**.  

### 5. **Sales Forecasting by Store**  
- If more stores are included, compare sales performance across stores.  
- Identify top-performing stores and potential reasons for their success.  

### 6. **Weather Impact on Sales**  
- Analyze how **Temperature** affects weekly sales.  
- Check if extreme weather leads to significant sales increases or drops.  

### 7. **Economic Stress Testing**  
- Simulate how rising **fuel prices** or a higher **unemployment rate** might affect store sales.
