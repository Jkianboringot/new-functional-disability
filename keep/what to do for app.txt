create an function that will lessen the berden on the laptop by making binary file where all the 
visualization will be stored and you can just call it when user want to see it itbasically storing 
the graph and user can just more it around but by doing this instead of rerunning it, it will just call it
 and it will just show and user can do what ever they want with it 


plan to use



app layout:
createa  plan on waht you want to do with your project 

what do i want:
	i want an website or app that will visuallize my finding from simple to advance do i dont just want to show choroleth but other visualization too do am thing should 
	i make it multi page or single page just manipulate so it small like the visualization in tabluae or a scroll type 
final verdict:
frame work = streamlit and maybe transition to something like dash
		- easy to use and deploy completely free too
	i think i will do it in a report type way where you can scroll down
		-why:
			i want it to look like a report style where you can read about the analysis and the type then this for every analysis but this might
			cause the app to be either slow or crash so yo atleast mitigate this i will make a bin file where it will store the graph and just reaccess it
			and use streamlit @st.cache_resource 

ACTION:
1.visualization
	-visualize first so that you know what to to use in choroleth 
	-i will use total_disability_population in main.ipynb fro choroleth but i can filter by disability and the 
		value will be the average and if the data is to shit i will just use np.log10 or somthing
2.file management
	-create a fucntion that will automate the file management as it will be the place where i will store 
graph file
